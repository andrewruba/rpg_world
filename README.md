# rpg_world

**rpg_world** is a Python library designed to simplify the creation of RPGs by providing a robust backend system for managing RPG **game state**. Whether you're developing classic turn-based RPGs or real-time combat systems, **rpg_world** offers a comprehensive framework to manage the intricacies of character progression, combat mechanics, inventory systems, quests, dialogues, and more. By focusing on the backend game logic, it significantly reduces the complexity of developing RPGs, making them more accessible to developers of all levels.

> **Note:** While **rpg_world** is specialized in managing the backend game logic and state, it does not include functionalities traditionally provided by full-fledged game engines, such as graphics rendering, audio processing, or real-time visual effects. This design allows **rpg_world** to be seamlessly integrated into existing projects or serve as a backend component for custom game engines, giving developers the freedom to pair it with their preferred tools for visuals and other front-end features.

## Quick Start

Here's a quick example to get you started with creating characters, abilities, and simulating a simple battle.

### Creating Characters

```python
from rpg_world.character.base_character import BaseCharacter
from rpg_world.character.character_stats import CharacterStats

# Create character stats
stats = CharacterStats(health=120, mana=80, strength=15, defense=10)

# Create a base character
hero = BaseCharacter(name="Arthas", stats=stats)
```

### Defining Abilities and Spells

```python
from rpg_world.ability.spell import Spell

# Define a spell
fireball = Spell(
    name="Fireball",
    mana_cost=20,
    cooldown=5.0,
    effects=[]  # Add spell effects here
)
```

### Simulating a Battle

```python
from rpg_world.combat.battle_manager import BattleManager

# Create enemy characters
enemy_stats = CharacterStats(health=100, mana=50, strength=12, defense=8)
goblin = BaseCharacter(name="Goblin", stats=enemy_stats)

# Initialize battle manager with player and enemy parties
battle_manager = BattleManager(player_party=[hero], enemy_party=[goblin])

# Run the battle
battle_manager.run_battle()
```

## Usage

### Creating Characters

# Create stats for a mage
mage_stats = CharacterStats(health=80, mana=150, strength=8, defense=5)

# Create a mage character
mage = Mage(name="Gandalf", stats=mage_stats)
```

### Defining Abilities and Spells

BaseAbility: The base class for all abilities.

Spell: A subclass of BaseAbility tailored for spellcasting.

```python
from rpg_world.ability.spell import Spell
from rpg_world.effect.spell_effect import SpellEffect

# Define a spell effect
burn = SpellEffect(effect_type="burn", damage=15, duration=3)

# Create a spell
flame_strike = Spell(
    name="Flame Strike",
    mana_cost=25,
    cooldown=10.0,
    effects=[burn]
)
```

### Managing Combat

BattleManager: Manages the flow of battles.

TurnOrder: Handles the sequence of turns in turn-based combat.

ActionQueue: Manages actions in real-time combat.

```python
from rpg_world.combat.battle_manager import BattleManager

# Initialize battle manager
battle_manager = BattleManager(player_party=[mage], enemy_party=[goblin])

# Start and run the battle
battle_manager.run_battle()
```

### Handling Items and Inventory

Item: Base class for all items.

Consumable: Items like potions that can be used.

Equipment: Items like weapons and armor that can be equipped.

Inventory: Manages a collection of items.

```python
from rpg_world.item.consumable import Consumable
from rpg_world.item.equipment import Equipment
from rpg_world.item.inventory import Inventory

# Create items
health_potion = Consumable(name="Health Potion", description="Heals 50 HP", value=50, healing_amount=50)
iron_sword = Equipment(name="Iron Sword", description="A sturdy iron sword", value=100, attack_bonus=5, defense_bonus=0)

# Create inventory and add items
inventory = Inventory()
inventory.add_item(health_potion)
inventory.add_item(iron_sword)

# List items
inventory.list_items()

# Use a consumable
inventory.use_item(health_potion, mage)

# Equip equipment
iron_sword.equip(mage)
```

### World and Exploration

World: Represents the entire game world.

Location: Specific areas within the world.

Event: Triggers and actions within locations.

```python
from rpg_world.world.world import World
from rpg_world.world.location import Location
from rpg_world.world.event import Event

# Create a world instance
game_world = World()

# Create locations
village = Location(name="Village", description="A peaceful village with friendly inhabitants.")
forest = Location(name="Forest", description="A dense forest teeming with wildlife.")

# Connect locations
village.add_connected_location("Forest")
forest.add_connected_location("Village")

# Add locations to the world
game_world.add_location(village)
game_world.add_location(forest)

# Set the starting location
game_world.set_starting_location("Village")

# Move to a different location
game_world.move_to_location("Forest")
```

### Quests and Objectives

Quest: Represents a quest with multiple objectives and rewards.

QuestObjective: Individual tasks within a quest.

QuestManager: Manages active quests and their progression.

```python
from rpg_world.quest.quest import Quest
from rpg_world.quest.quest_objective import QuestObjective
from rpg_world.quest.quest_manager import QuestManager

# Define quest objectives
collect_herbs = QuestObjective(description="Collect 5 healing herbs")
defeat_goblin = QuestObjective(description="Defeat the forest goblin")

# Create a quest
herbal_remedy = Quest(
    name="Herbal Remedy",
    description="Collect herbs and defeat the forest goblin to create a healing potion.",
    objectives=[collect_herbs, defeat_goblin],
    rewards={"gold": 100, "experience": 50}
)

# Initialize quest manager and add quest
quest_manager = QuestManager()
quest_manager.add_quest(herbal_remedy)

# List active quests
quest_manager.list_active_quests()

# Mark objectives as completed
collect_herbs.mark_completed()
defeat_goblin.mark_completed()

# Complete the quest
quest_manager.complete_quest(herbal_remedy)
```

### Dialogue System

DialogueManager: Manages dialogue sequences and branching options.

DialogueNode: Represents individual lines or choices in dialogue.

DialogueScript: Contains predefined dialogue scripts for NPCs or events.

```python
from rpg_world.dialogue.dialogue_manager import DialogueManager
from rpg_world.dialogue.dialogue_node import DialogueNode

# Create dialogue nodes
greet = DialogueNode(text="Hello, traveler! Welcome to our village.", choices=None)
ask_help = DialogueNode(text="Can you help us with our quest?", choices=["Yes", "No"])

# Define a dialogue script
village_greeting = DialogueScript(name="VillageGreeting", nodes=[greet, ask_help])

# Initialize dialogue manager and add script
dialogue_manager = DialogueManager()
dialogue_manager.add_script(village_greeting)

# Start a dialogue
dialogue_manager.start_dialogue("VillageGreeting")
```

### Skill Trees

SkillTree: Manages the structure and dependencies of skills.

SkillNode: Represents individual skills within the tree.

SkillManager: Handles skill point allocation and progression.

```python
from rpg_world.skill_tree.skill_tree import SkillTree

# Define skill nodes
fire_mastery = SkillNode(name="Fire Mastery", description="Increase fire spell damage.", prerequisites=[])
ice_mastery = SkillNode(name="Ice Mastery", description="Increase ice spell damage.", prerequisites=["Fire Mastery"])

# Create a skill tree
mage_skill_tree = SkillTree(root_skills=[fire_mastery])

# Add skills to the tree
mage_skill_tree.add_skill(ice_mastery)

# Initialize skill manager
skill_manager = SkillManager(skill_tree=mage_skill_tree)

# Allocate skill points
skill_manager.unlock_skill("Fire Mastery")
skill_manager.unlock_skill("Ice Mastery")

### Leveling and Experience

ExperienceManager: Manages experience gain and leveling up.

LevelCurve: Defines XP thresholds for each level.

```python
